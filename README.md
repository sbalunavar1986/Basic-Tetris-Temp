#This is a simple no nonsense version of Tetris that has no styling - made for my learning.


In this game of Tetris I will be covering the following inbuilt JavaScript methods:

    addEventListener()
    querySelector()
    querySelectorAll()
    keyCode()
    Math.floor()
    Math.random()
    length
    forEach()
    splice()
    clearInterval()
    setInterval()
    some()
    innerHTML()
    every()
    add()
    remove()
    contains()

What I expect to learn

    The fundamentals of JavaScript
    Setting up your code editor
    Understanding the command prompt tool
    The basics of HTML
    Understanding CSS
